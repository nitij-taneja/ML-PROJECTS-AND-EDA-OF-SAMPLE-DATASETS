# ML Projects and EDA of Sample Datasets

Welcome to the **ML Projects and EDA of Sample Datasets** repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects that I have completed during my learning phase in data science and machine learning. Each project showcases different datasets and techniques used for data analysis and visualization.

## Projects Overview

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the files included in this repository:

* **Report_covid19_critical_trial_eda.html**: An HTML report presenting an exploratory data analysis on COVID-19 clinical trial data.
* **SVM.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification tasks.
* **Youtube_Project_(1).ipynb**: A project focused on analyzing YouTube data, exploring trends, and visualizing key insights.
* **covid19_clinical_trial_eda.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook for EDA on clinical trial datasets related to COVID-19.
* **credit_card_applicants_eda.ipynb**: An analysis of credit card applicants, focusing on feature importance and decision-making processes.
* **eda_titanic_profilereport.ipynb**: An EDA project on the Titanic dataset, including survival predictions and feature exploration.
* **netflix_eda.ipynb**: An analysis of Netflix data to explore trends and insights from the streaming service.
* **report (1).html**: Another report presenting an EDA on a dataset, providing insights through visualizations.
* **rohit_eda.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing exploratory analysis on a dataset named "Rohit."
* **spotify_eda.ipynb**: An EDA project focusing on Spotify data, analyzing song characteristics and user preferences.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the Jupyter notebooks and HTML reports available in this repository. Each project demonstrates various techniques and methodologies in data analysis and visualization.

## Future Plans

I will continue to update this repository with more projects and EDA analyses as I progress in my learning journey in data science and machine learning.
